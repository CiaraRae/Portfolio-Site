                            <p>
                                As the semester began, and I considered my own digital literacy, I classified my learning as <i>"a story of making things up as I go"</i>.
                                While I would love to say that my methods have become more sophisticated over time, this course has shown me that <b>when it comes to learning and
                                adapting to new technology, trial and error is inevitable</b>. My desire to understand everything (and by extension be good at everything), made the 
                                start of semester intimidating. Diving into new topics that I was completely unfamiliar with, from HTML & CSS to static site hosting, left me anxiously 
                                wondering if my digital literacy would advance quickly enough to keep up. However, looking back on how much we've accomplished in a few short months, it
                                makes me proud to review my completed projects. 
                            </p>
                            <p>   
                                Likewise, while I've discovered so many new resources (see my Personal Learning Network section for a better demonstration) this experience has also made me 
                                realize that the virtual classroom learning experience, with its supportive peer community and curated documents, is an ideal space for me when exploring complicated 
                                topics. It makes the process much more managable and keeps me accountable to continue progressing. <b>I am not sure how far I would have gotten if it hadn't been for the 
                                resources posted to Canvas each week</b> or the instructional materials specifically made for each module. The structure of the course removed the debilitating fear of "where do I even begin",
                                and made it easy to expand my learning into specific topics independently. Unsurprisingly, like I had known prior to the course, I gravitated
                                toward materials that were highly visual. However, what did surprise me was that as the semester went along I didn't rely as heavily on videos for instructions. I was thankful
                                for them when we learned new platforms (when working on our DITA project in OXygen I was particuarly grateful for the quick video tutorial), but when it came to writing code I 
                                found that looking at examples was what helped me the most. Inspecting pages and learning how each rule and component worked together progressed my comprehension and retention
                                over time, even after weeks had passed without us focusing on it. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                I am very grateful for this experience and for my newfound confidence in venturing into a technical world that I didn't know that I would be given access to. <b>The idea that I could
                                create and host my own site or help others with web design projects is a thrilling new possibility.</b> I also have a newfound respect for those who venture into these topics 
                                independently without as many guiding tools as I received. I have no doubt that this course will help to launch me into bigger and better creative endeavors in the future.
                            </p></br>
                            <h2>Personal Learning Network</h2>
                            <p>
                                A crucial component of advancing digital literacy is to build a strong personal learning network of peers and supporters. At the beginning of the semester,
                                I outlined the start of the academic, professional, and personal resources I rely on. Since then, my resources have expanded drastically. From establishing
                                new HTML/CSS resources in W3 Schools to identifying web developer portfolios that inspire my own work, I am excited to look back on how my network continues to develop. 
                                As you can see summarized in the chart below, this course has put me well on my way to branching into new tools and support systems.
